# Solar-Saving-Calculator



## Project Overview
This project involved building a custom Excel tool with an interactive VBA UserForm designed to estimate future electricity costs without solar installation and project potential savings. The client, a solar energy consultant, needed a user-friendly interface to demonstrate long-term cost projections for prospective customers, helping them visualize the financial impact of not switching to solar energy.
Their goal was to present a dynamic cost calculator that could adjust based on the userâ€™s current electric bill, anticipated annual rate increases, and the time period under consideration. Key functionality included slider controls for user inputs, real-time estimated cost calculation, and a visually intuitive layout.

I built a VBA UserForm with input sliders, preset default values, and automated calculations triggered by a single button. Error handling was added to catch invalid entries.
